Before transiting the Canal, the vessel should be provided with a searchlight ( projector ) complying with the following conditions and specifications.

It should be placed on the bow in the axis of the vessel and show the Canal clearly.

Specifications are as follows :

Minimum range of radiation of single beam 1800 m. ahead ( Brightness of 1 LUX approx, at the atmospheric transmission factor T = 0.85 ).

The power of the lamp must give a luminous intensity of single light beam not less than 3 x 106 ( 3 million ) candles, which is equivalent to a high efficiency incandescent lamp of :

2000 watt for vessels up to 30000 SC.G.T.

3000 watt for vessels over 30000 SC.G.T.

Or any kind of lamps which that fulfills the specifications, under item (2) above and to be of the nonexplosive type.

The drum and stand should be of high corrosion resisting material and can be operated both horizontally and vertically.

The front glass must be of hardened type and can stand rapid cooling.

The reflector must be in two halves of precise ground glass mirror of highest quality or of polished aluminum having at least 95% the reflective capacity of the glass mirror.

The two halves of the reflector can be brought together (zero position) to make a single reflector light beam and can be parted to give two separate light beams each of 5 degree at least on the horizontal level with adjustable dark sector from 0 to 10 degree.

The searchlight drum must be watertight (pressure test 0.25 kg/cm2), and the electric system ( switches, plugs, socket and cables ) must be of 1 st class marine type with degree of protection IP55.

Gastight searchlight ( according to the classification rules ) for the vessel's having electric appliances within the dangerous area , and provided with a vent - out of which a flexible hose can be fitted on the drum to dissipate the heated air out of the searchlight in addition to a safety vent.
On vessels carrying Petroleum products, L.N.G. or inflammable substances or vessels Not Gas Free, exit of hot air must be effectuated in a place devoid of inflammable gas.

The searchlight must be equipped with 2 lamps carrier that can be turned into position to let the lamp exactly in the focus of the reflector, and the current must be switched on automatically.

The searchlight must have a certificate for the “Type Test”. This type test must include illuminate test to fulfill the above specifications, issued by one of the Classification Societies ( Lloyd's Register, etc. ). The original to be submitted to Suez Canal Officials and thereby, after test by SCA Inspector, the searchlight can be accepted.

On all vessels mentioned in item ( 2-h ) , electric cables installations for searchlight and all connections leading to it must be permanently fixed, insulated and gastight.
At the end of the cables, a fixed and gastight nonexplosive type socket should be installed close to the searchlight.

On board vessels, electrically propelled or having electrically driven gear ( steering, winches, etc. ) the number of generators and their individual power output must be sufficient to ensure uninterrupted functioning of the searchlight in the event of stoppage of one of the generators, No exception to this rule will be allowed except when there is an independent generator and circuit on board specifically set apart for the searchlight.

A portable projector can be hired locally from the Canal Mooring and lights Company ( weight of projector about 22 kg ).

For vessels fitted with their own projector, two shore electricians should operate the projecter during the transit.

Vessels with special cases :

L.P.G. and L.N.G. vessels, without any exceptions, must be provided with their own searchlight.

Vessels entering the Canal, direct from sea, must be provided also with their own searchlight.

Yachts and tugs up to 150 SC.G.T. can transit with their own projectors, on condition that the unit is equipped with at least 2 projectors, each with a capacity of not less than 1000 watt, no shore electricians will board.

If having deck loads protruding from vessel's sides in a manner endangering the safety of transit(6).

If the vessel is so tender or loaded in a manner that dangerously affects her stability.

If the draught is in excess of the maximum permissible draught as stated in the SC Rules of Navigation.
